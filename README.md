Build  a  publishing  gateway for Twitter like sproutsocial or TweetRoost  where groups of users can post from a single account. Express framework was used for the implementation of our project. We used client-­‐side JavaScript and jQuery, Node.js	to build our web	application. JSON server was used	 to store back-­‐end data.The front-­‐end	 styling of the webpage was done using Bootstrap.
